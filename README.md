# Weather App

The main criteria were to use the proper API to accurately show the weather forecast, either based on the current location or a user-selected location, with also the aspect of two different layouts and a plethora of different looks depending on the weather cast at hand.

Custom backgrounds for both day and night based on the current condition. The first location selected will be user based. A search is available with autosuggestions. The user can see the current temperature, a 3-day forecast, and a 9-hour forecast, change the units and choose between layouts.
